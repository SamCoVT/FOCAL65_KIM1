Hi Dave,

My section of FOCAL code is done. I made a fair few amends. Mostly updating label names, some missing characters in label names, few missing instructions, nothing much on the whole.

Question 2:

    Then around line 2437 I have this code ...

    CHKODV    CMP #$03          ;COMPARE AC AGAINST MAX ALLOWED

    That should be this ...

    CHKODV    CMP #ODEVM          ;COMPARE AC AGAINST MAX ALLOWED

    But the ODEVM label isn't defined. However I can find a comment that's not in my section of code around line 3767 ...

    ;
    ;     DISPATCH TABLE FOR I/O DEVICE NUMBERS
    ;
    ; handwritten note in P/E source: "READ/WRITE"
    ; Two definitions made here:
    ;     .DEF IDEWVM=3     .DEF ODEVM=3  ; MAX # OF I/O DEVICES
    ;

    So presume that needs to be defined. Thoughts? :)

Kind regards,
Gavin.
