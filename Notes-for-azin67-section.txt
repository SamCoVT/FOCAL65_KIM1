NOTES FOR SECTION $281C-$2C4A (ORIGINALLY FOR AZIN67), DONE BY D. HASSLER


PUSHJ (AT $281C)
	DEFINED LABEL PJADR1 = $282F IN THE DEFINITIONS SECTION, ABOVE ORG ASSIGNMENT.

PHFAC1 (AT $2879) THROUGH PLTMP (AT $28A5)
	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE USE OF "NEGATIVE LABELS"; I NEED HELP WITH THIS (I LEFT THE RAW MEMORY LOCATION INTACT)

PRINTC (AT $2902)
	IN THE ORIGINAL DENVER 6502 GROUP CODE, THERE IS AN OBVIOUS PATCH GLUED OVER THE ORIGINAL CODE.  THE ARESCO (WORKING) CODE IS DIFFERENT UP TO PUSEA1 ($2913).

I UNCOMMENTED LINCHR AND ALTCHR	IN THE DEFINITIONS AREA SO THEY GIVE VALUES LATER.
